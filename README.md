# Pylians3 - Brenda edition

This is a Pylians3 fork that contains some minor modifications in the Pk library to include interlacing, log binning, etc...

## Installation

For the development version do

```sh 
git clone https://github.com/Mattesposito/Pylians3_brenda_ed.git
cd Pylians3_brenda_ed
python -m pip install .
```


## Usage

Pylians3 is a set of python libraries, written in python, cython and C, whose purposes is to facilitate the analysis of numerical simulations (both N-body and hydrodynamic). Among other things, they can be used to:

-   Compute density fields
-   Compute power spectra
-   Compute bispectra
-   Compute correlation functions
-   Identify voids
-   Populate halos with galaxies using an HOD
-   Apply HI+H2 corrections to the output of hydrodynamic simulations
-   Make 21cm maps
-   Compute DLAs column density distribution functions
-   Plot density fields and make movies
